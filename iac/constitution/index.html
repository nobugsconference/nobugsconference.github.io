<h1>NOBUGS Terms of Reference</h1>

<p>The term NOBUGS is a shorthand for "New Opportunities for Better User
Group Software". The aim of this body is to foster the collaboration between
scientists and IT professionals working for photon, muon and neutron user
facilities. The intended benefit of this collaboration is better data
acquisition and analysis software which helps users to get the most out
of their experiments at such expensive facilities. The activities of
the NOBUGS group focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The organisation of the NOBUGS Conference every two years</li>
  <li>Fostering discussions and collaborations between facilities on software projects</li>
  <li>Act as a lobbying body for better scientific software</li>
</ul>

<h1>NOBUGS International Advisory Committee</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Agrees and recommends a programme for the NOBUGS conferences to provide
a balanced overview of important topics and developments covering all
types of IT projects relevant to photon, muon and neutron user facilities.</p>

<p>To provide a link between facilities to initiate discussions and collaborations.</p>

<h2>Membership</h2>

<p>The NOBUGS International Advisory Committee strives to include exactly one 
individual as representative for each major photon, muon or neutron user facility.  
New members can be nominated from attendees of the NOBUGS conference and 
should be confirmed in the conference's NOBUGS International Advisory 
Committee meeting.</p>

<p>The membership term is not limited. However, if a member of the
NOBUGS International Advisory Committee fails to attend two successive
NOBUGS conferences the membership in the NOBUGS International Advisory
Committee will automatically expire.  Each NOBUGS International Advisory
Committee member can nominate a substitute to attend a particular meeting
or conference.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p>The committee conducts its business either electronically or through 
meetings. Committee meetings occur during NOBUGS conferences.  
The NOBUGS International Advisory Committee appoints one officer, 
the chairman. The chairman's task is to oversee deliberations. 
The chairman's term of service is two years.</p>

<p>The NOBUGS International Advisory Committee tasks a local organizing
committee with the organization of a NOBUGS conference.</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee and the local organisers
jointly decide on the key topics and other important parameters of
the upcoming conference.  The local organizing committee compiles a
conference programme from the abstracts submitted for presentation at the
conference. During the programme compilation phase the NOBUGS International
Organizing Committee is to be involved through its mailing list.</p>
